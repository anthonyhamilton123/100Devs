//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.

let movieList = ['bring it on', 'bring it on again', 'bring it on all or nothing']

//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable

let bestMovie = movieList[0]

//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable

let movieListLength = movieList.length

//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?

let lastMovie = movieList[-1]
